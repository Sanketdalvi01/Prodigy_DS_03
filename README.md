In the project centered around building a decision tree classifier using the Bank.csv file, the goal was to create an effective model for predicting whether a customer would purchase a product or service, leveraging demographic and behavioral data. The Bank.csv dataset served as the foundation for this endeavor, containing essential information about customers, including features such as age, income, education, and previous transaction history. A decision tree, a powerful machine learning algorithm capable of discerning patterns and relationships within complex datasets, was employed for classification purposes. 
Through a process of training and validation, the decision tree learned to make predictions based on the provided features. This approach allowed for the extraction of interpretable rules that could be applied to new, unseen data to predict customer purchase behavior. The resulting decision tree model not only provided accurate predictions but also offered valuable insights into the key factors influencing customer decisions, aiding businesses in optimizing their marketing and sales strategies.
